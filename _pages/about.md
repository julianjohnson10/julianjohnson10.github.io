Nice to meet you! My name is Julian Johnson.

I am a U.S. Air Force veteran with over 8 years of hands-on experience in the IT industry. The field of cybersecurity has enabled me to become a subject matter expert in various disciplines, such as endpoint protection, vulnerability management, and software engineering.

I hold a B.S. in Software Development from Western Governors University, and an A.A.S from the Community College of the Air Force. Over the past decade I have gathered a diverse set of skills and highly sought after certifications, reflecting my commitment to continuous improvement and self-learning.
